Write a plot for a comedic novel set in a distant future where humans have colonized other planets. A group of hapless explorers stumble upon a mysterious alien artifact that turns out to be a kitchen appliance from a long-lost civilization. Hilarity ensues as they try to figure out how to use it and what it does. The main character should be a bumbling captain of the team, but with a heart of gold.
