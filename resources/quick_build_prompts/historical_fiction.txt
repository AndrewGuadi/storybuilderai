Create a plot for a historical fiction novel set in a future where humans have colonized other planets. A group of explorers discover a mysterious artifact from a long-extinct alien civilization that sheds light on the mysteries of human history. The main character should be a brilliant archaeologist leading the team, but with a troubled past that they must overcome.
