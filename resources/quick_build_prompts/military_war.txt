Create a plot for a military/war novel set in a future where humans have colonized other planets. A group of soldiers discover a mysterious alien artifact that could turn the tide of their ongoing conflict with an alien race. As they fight their way through enemy territory to retrieve the artifact, they must also contend with internal rivalries and personal demons. The main character should be a battle-hardened and decisive commander of the team, but with a tragic past that fuels their drive for victory.
