Write a plot for a western novel set in a future where humans have colonized other planets. A group of bounty hunters discover a mysterious alien artifact that could make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. As they travel through the dangerous frontier, they must contend with rival gangs and alien creatures. The main character should be a grizzled and tough bounty hunter leading the team, but with a soft spot for justice.
